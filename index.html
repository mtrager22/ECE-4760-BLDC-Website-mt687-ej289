        <h3> BLDC Motors</h3>
          <p class="project">
              The brushless DC (BLDC) motor is often characterized by its high reliability, high efficiency, 
              and lower cost. BLDC motors are overall considered more cost-effective relative to other categories 
              of motors (e.g. brushed DC motors). Although the term “brushless” can be ambiguous—in fact, nearly all 
              types of motors other than brushed DC motors are generally brushless—the term “BLDC motor” generally refers to a 
              “permanent magnet synchronous motor with a trapezoidal Back EMF waveform shape” [1]. This is in contrast to the general definition 
              of a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM), which generally refers to a motor with a sinusoidal Back EMF waveform shape. 
              The architecture of the BLDC motor features a permanent magnet rotor surrounded by windings serving as the stator. Most commonly, 
              the stator consists of three phases, which is generally acknowledged to provide the best compromise between precise control and the complexity 
              of the motor control [1]. By applying appropriate currents to each of the stator windings, a magnetic field can be generated and controlled appropriately 
              to lead the permanent magnet serving as the rotor.  This results in the rotation of the rotor in a manner synchronized with the magnetic field 
              generated by the stator windings. In order to apply the greatest torque, the stator magnetic field should lead the rotor magnetic field by 90°.
          </p>
        <h3>Why Trapezoidal Control?</h3>
          
          <p class="project">
            The ideal motor can be modeled with the wye configuration (sometimes referred to as the 
            Y configuration) pictured below. 
          </p>
          
          <img src="images/wye_configuration.png" style="margin: auto; display: block;" width="500">

          <p class="project">
            The motor is controlled by applying voltages to each of the phases. It is by means of 
            changing these voltages that the current, and thus the magnetic field within the motor, 
            is changed. In order to create a stator magnetic field that might lead the rotor magnetic field, 
            one of the phases should be driven to the bus voltage, one of the phases should be driven to ground, 
            and the remaining phase should be tristated. The state to which each of the phases should be driven depends on 
            the target stator magnetic field. Because we define the target stator magnetic field to be leading the rotor magnetic 
            field by 90°, the state to which each of the phases should be driven can be determined by the orientation of the rotor.
